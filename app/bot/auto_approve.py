"""Hands-off receipt approval, for when the superadmin is away.

While it is on, every receipt that arrives is approved a minute after it lands.
That minute is the superadmin's window: the receipt still reaches them with its
buttons, and starting a rejection inside it wins. Receipts already waiting when
it was switched on are left for a person — switching it on decides what happens
next, it doesn't wave the backlog through.
