"""Weekly credit billing, on Tehran local time.

Two fixed points in the Persian week, both at 08:00 Asia/Tehran:
  • Wednesday — two days before the week ends: remind each debtor what they owe.
  • Friday — the end of the week: take what the wallet covers, tell each debtor
    what (if anything) is still outstanding, and send the superadmin the roster.

Each run is stamped with its ISO year-week so a restart, or the loop ticking
more than once inside the same hour, can't double-send.
